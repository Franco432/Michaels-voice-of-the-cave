# Michael's voice of the cave

## Game Description
This is a little game that occurs in a cave, where you have to fight with monsters, collect items, and defeat a final boss to win it.

It was an entry for the https://itch.io/jam/untitled-game-jam-81, and you can play the original jam version in https://franco-c.itch.io/michaels-task.

I made this repository to rewrite it and improve it, because it wasn't a good game when I submitted it to the jam.

### Screnshots of the original version
This screenshots show the original gameplay, and the final game is not supposed to be very different to it
